""" I have made the previous library system based on an Idea of basic library uses
In this one I am gonna make some enhancements mainly incluidibg the following.

Beta features :
These features have been introduiced as a modification to the previous version
1. Book code : To acess books in an index specific way.
2. Genre : Specifies what the books' content deals with. Can be easily searched up by the user.
3. Menu driven and easy to use.
4. Enhanced fine calculation scheme.
5. Data storage modifications.
6. Making books standard specific.Indicating age indirectly(ex : for and above class 6).
7. User has to pay the price of the book if lost.
8. Voice feature removed due to delay caused by it's execution time.
9. Program is dynamic as data is not erased as the program.
      Code comments added to make it readable by others


REQUIREMENTS FOR RUNNING THE PROGRAM : 
      1. MongoDB(Either server or local db. Both works)
      2. MongoShell(preffered for programmers) / MongoDB Compass to view, edit, update databases
      3. python interpreter(visit :  www.python.org)
      4. Pymongo extension to connect MongoDB to python
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THAT'S ALL------------------------------------------------------------------------------
